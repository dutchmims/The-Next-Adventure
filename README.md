## Project Overview

### The Next Adventure

The Next Adventure is a text based adventure game designed to entertain, keep players guessing, create tension and excite game players. The game starts with you as the protagonist, waking up in a strange and mysterious room, confused and scared, without any memory of how you got there. In front of you there are 3 doors for you to choose from, a black door, a yellow door, and a white door. You have to choose between different doors, rooms and paths to find your way through the game. Your task is to get to the end and win the game. Be careful though. The decisions you make will be your fate. The game is designed with a PG rating as It is a slow, suspenseful game, with tension building throughout until you learn your fate, Win or Die. It starts with 3 doors for you to choose from, a black door, a yellow door, and a white door. Once you have made your choice, you are brought through a series of events, scenarios, rooms and ultimately choices which bring you through a strange and mysterious world where the right path could save your life or the wrong door could end it!

# Design

## Flowchart

This games story, flow, choices and decisions were all designed by myself. I used figma to map out the game, with each and every scenario and outcome. The game can end extremely quickly if one chooses the wrong door and makes a wrong turn, on the other hand, if one chooses all the correct doors, paths etc. it is extremely involved and engrossing. It initially starts with a the player having to choose a door and so on.

# Technologies Used

## Languages

1. Python was used to create and design the game

## Frameworks and Tools

1. Github was the version control used.
2. Gitpod was the IDE used.
3. Figma was used to produce wireframes.
4. Heroku is where the game is hosted.


# Testing

- I found several bugs while coding this project. I rectified these with tutorials from w3 schools and stack overflow.
- I had issues with heroku at the beginning, which set me back several days as I needed Heroku customer support to advise me.
- After runing CI Python Linter, I had numerous issues. As much of the story was longer than 80 characters, I had to re-write much of it at the last minute.

### Manual Testing

I played the game and tested all the routes throughout the game. Initially I found issues. I kept testing while writing more of the program and came across numerous issus which I fixed and corrected. The functions also faced issues in the early stages, but I was able to fix these issues.

# Deployment

### The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps taken are as follows:

1. Log in to Github
2. In the repository "The-Next-Adventure", navigate to the settings tab from the top menu.
3. In settings select pages.
4. From the source section, select the Master Branch and then save.
5. The page is refreshed and you will then see the URL of your website.

### The site is live and hosted by Heroku

1. The project utilized CI's mock terminal.
2. In Gitpod, I ran "pip3 freeze > requirements.txt in the terminal before creating a new app in Heroku.
3. In Heroku click on "Create a new app" tab.
4. Name the new app and select your region.
5. In "Settings", click on "Reveal Config Vars" tab and input the folloing, KEY: PORT, VALUE: 8000.
6. In "Settings" click on "Add buildpack" tab and select Python and Node.js, in this order.
8. Move to the "Deploy" section and select Github and confirm you want to connect to Github.
9. Type in the repository you want to deploy.
10. You can either choose to set "Automatic Deploys" or the manual option "Deploy Branch".
11. Click on the required tab and Heroku will build your app.
12. A tab will appear with your app successfully deployed.
13. Click this tab "View" to see you app live.
