## Project Overview

### The Next Adventure

The Next Adventure is a text based adventure game designed to entertain, keep players guessing, create tension and excite game players. The game starts with you as the protagonist, waking up in a strange and mysterious room, confused and scared, without any memory of how you got there. In front of you there are 3 doors for you to choose from, a black door, a yellow door, and a white door. You have to choose between different doors, rooms and paths to find your way through the game. Your task is to get to the end and win the game. Be careful though. The decisions you make will be your fate. The game is designed with a PG rating as It is a slow, suspenseful game, with tension building throughout until you learn your fate, Win or Die. It starts with 3 doors for you to choose from, a black door, a yellow door, and a white door. Once you have made your choice, you are brought through a series of events, scenarios, rooms and ultimately choices which bring you through a strange and mysterious world where the right path could save your life or the wrong door could end it!
